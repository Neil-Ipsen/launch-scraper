# Launch Scraper

**Description**
Launch Scraper is a web scraper, built on Python, designed to gather data on United States rocket launches from [Spaceflight Now](https://www.spaceflightnow.com/launch-schedule/) and place that data in [Google Calendar](https://www.calendar.google.com/) with reminders so that the user will know about the event automatically.
